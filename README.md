# Legacy PawnScript Project – Captcha System (Learning Replica)

⚠️ **Legacy Learning Project (built when I was 16 years old)**  
This repository contains code I wrote as a teenager while learning PawnScript and SA-MP server scripting.  
It does **not** reflect my current coding standards or best practices.

Shared to document my learning journey and early interest in system design, gameplay mechanics, and feature replication through observation.

## 🧠 Context

At the time, many players used automation tools to farm in-game rewards by leaving their characters working for long periods of time.

On several popular SA-MP servers, certain jobs required players to complete a simple human verification step (such as a captcha) after finishing a task in order to receive the reward.

By observing how these systems behaved from a player’s perspective, I attempted to **replicate a similar gameplay mechanic** for learning purposes.  
This was done without access to any server source code and without copying any proprietary implementations.

The goal of this project was purely educational:  
to understand how such systems can be designed and implemented on the server side.
